# Instructions

1. Download this project [here](https://github.com/Nnoggie/SharedMedia_ExampleName/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Drag the folder SharedMedia_ExampleName-main to your World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder
3. Rename the folder SharedMedia_ExampleName-main to whatever you want your custom media AddOn to be called
4. Add media to the corresponding folders
5. Run UpdateMedia.bat to create / update the AddOn files
6. Create a project on Wago Addons and upload your AddOn

- issue: X-WAGO-ID, have them enter the ID in bat the first time the toc is created?
- read the toc file and get the ID from there afterwards
- step 6 should probably be the first one
